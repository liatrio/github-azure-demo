# GitHub Actions + Azure App Service demo

This project demonstrates using GitHub Actions to test, build and deploy an application to Azure App Service.

It uses the [Realworld example application](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) to demonstrate the pipeline and services. The application is built using the [Realworld ASP.NET Core backend](https://github.com/gothinkster/aspnetcore-realworld-example-app) combined with the [Realworld React frontend](https://github.com/gothinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app).
